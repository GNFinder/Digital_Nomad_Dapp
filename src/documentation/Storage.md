# Storage

### Intro

This was one of the areas I wanted to explore the most because of its focus on the consumer's expectations vs traditional server storage. I found many ways of storing data for both centralised and decentralised methods.

Traditional private local server storage meaning an obscurity from harmful vulnerabilities and poor software architecture from the public is a matter of fact.
You can use a smart contract storage to store the list of previously generated hashes, so you can check for duplicates across multiple function calls.

It's worth noting that using storage to write previously given hashes can be costly in terms of gas, and also, you have to pay for storage. You could consider using an off-chain solution to store the hashes, for example, in a database or a server, or use a smart contract storage such as IPFS.

You should also consider the trade-offs between using smart contract storage and off-chain storage, such as the cost of gas, security and scalability.

Also, you could use a bloom filter, it's a probabilistic data structure to test whether an element is a member of a set, it's a more gas-efficient way than storing all the hashes in the storage.

## Decentralised vs Centralised

### What are they both

The two are opposites of one another. They are the directions of the services used by us.
A centralised service direction starts from the "centre" or inside outwards to its community or organisation, like a Church or Bank Institution. As you can imagine there are privileges to some information that may not make it all the way out to the public, for whatever reasons.

A decentralised services direction passes through the users hands before, during and throughout its use. Nothing is behind the scenes (in theory). This is like real-time, voting or the concept of digital money (crpto). 

The concept is a relatively new lifestyle choice for certain individuals who believe in such clarity and openness in the world.

## FireBase

So for storage we are looking at FireBase https://console.firebase.google.com/ 

No graphs, no charts, no articles, just reccomendations from fellow developers, its easy to use, and sign-up is via Gmail...PERFECT!

It is centralised however that allows for greater scalibilty, readiness and also some other cool features like an API for calls to our stored data, making development much more explosive potentially. 

It is worth mentioning that FileCoin really caught my eye too, and it is decentralised! I would like to dive deeper into this kind of storage for future projects I am on.
