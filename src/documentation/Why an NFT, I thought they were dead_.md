# Why an NFT, I thought they were dead?

Nope!

The real issue here is that traditional companies (Web2) getting into the space (Web3) are yet to fully comprehend "why" we need NFT's in the new world.

#### Why Do We Need NFT's?

The idea in the simplest of forms is that we can share information. YES, share information. Sounds weird doesn't it? The reality is in 2023 information is still not shared appropriately and in some cases illegally, even by the largest of cooperations in the world. Wow-zerz!

#### How does this effect Me?

Let's do an experiment! Think of the last company (Co-op) you "shared" your information with. Let's say you know how to read an email, unsubscribe to an email list, even go as far as to signing on the the Privacy policy/GDPR page of the company to "remove" all of your data.

Well congratulation, you can read and follow simple instructions, plus you are aware of data protection.

Now, what did Co-op do with your "info" before then. Did they stay true to their word. Did they change management in between causing a massive difference in the way they handle your data, after-all you gave them permission to do so at ANY time, right?

The point is, we'll never know for sure!

#### I still don't get it

I understand. It takes time to see how you have been giving away personal information just to buy socks or pyjamas for a loved ones birthday. It also takes a strength inside of you to think about why this happens in the first place but, that's another conversation my friend!

An NFT allows for you to share the data you want and only that.

A picture, an album, a form of currency are basic ways that companies are using it for in our transition from Web2 to Web3.

But this is for babies.

The reality is they can be used for anything you want to be **unique**.

So imagine the Co-op allowed you to make purchases with your own NFT or one that you know only has the data you are happy to partake in exchange for those goods you needed...

Or candidates were able to apply for jobs using one that clearly has previous employment references stored publicly...saving HR hundreds of hours

Or at schools when pupils are punished they have points removed from their, "Meta-Verse School Character NFT" or a point added for good behaviour, I would have minus points by the way...Nursery was tough!

Can you see how unique this can get yet?

# What I learned

## Open Source

Open source is the way I instinctively viewed the world when I was young, its like a playground where all you have to do is ask, "Can I play too?"

Of course some games (documentation) are much harder than others, but you can still play (learn).

Up until now I had been reluctant to share my personal projects publicly. Coming from a tradition business background this sounded like blasphemy.

Why would I share my idea(s) with potential competitors.

Wow, what an old fashioned, big meanie!

Was I really in it just for the money or was I truly trying to bring my solutions to the market and help change the world, even toothpaste does both I!

I truly understand the beauty of open-source now that I've used so many resources to help me build successful projects.

## Metadata Storage:

Moralis NFT API

## Confidence in ability to code:

Cracking the Coding Interview and Clean Code

## Consultancy skills:

I surprised myself at how all those years of struggling in business gave me a great insight in to the mindset of the average start-up/CEO and allowed for direct, specialised and specific consultancy regarding their exact brand and vision. Here's a gem, NFT's can be called anything, the issue is NFT is the scientific name for it and most consumers are not scientist. Be 100% more original!

## My Web3 Voice:

Truth is I did not want to pursue business after the lock-down. Too many uncertainties for me and my family at the time.

I became a mute because I had no inspiration to be inspiring.

I wanted revenge on the world for not giving me my immature dreams Hahaha...But seriously I wanted to really show the world I am here to contribute massively, not just reap the rewards like my immature dreams and so many successful influencers have as business goals.

I became a human being, from the roots of the community, looking through the world and not down upon.

# Conclusion

This project was meticulously developed paying attention specifically to, the latest available dependencies and technologies, the latest security audit concerns of Solidity Smart Contracts and any "holes" in my knowledge of the above.
